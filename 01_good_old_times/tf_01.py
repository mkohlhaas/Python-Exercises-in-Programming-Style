# The stop words are only 433 characters and the lines are all

# Overall strategy: (PART 1) read the input file, count the
# words, increment/store counts in secondary memory (a file)
# (PART 2) find the 25 most frequent words in secondary memory

# - read the input file one line at a time
# - filter the characters, normalize to lower case
# - identify words, increment corresponding counts in file

# Load the list of stop words
